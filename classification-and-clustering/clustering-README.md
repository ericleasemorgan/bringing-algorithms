# Topic modeling with metadata

This page outlines how to topic model a small corpus and then how to use metadata to illustrate how the resulting themes manifest themselves.

Topic modeling is a unsupervised machine learning process. Given a set of documents and an integer (t), a topic modeler will identify t latent themes, where each theme is a list of words which appear relatively close to each to each other. There are many topic modeling algorithms, but LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is generally considered the best one.
